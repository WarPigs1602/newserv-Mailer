# newserv-Mailer
 Attention: It's recommened to use NetBeans, for compiling and edit the sources.<br>
 <br>
 The experimental mailer for [newserv](https://github.com/quakenet/newserv) in java, that replaces the batcher when your server doesn't support python2.<br>
 I work currently on the encryption for compatiblilty with batcher.<br>
 <br>
 You can download the compiled package under https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16627124/newserv-Mailer.zip and extract it to the server.<br>
 Please make sure that you use the jre17 or higher.<br>
 <br>
 Have fun with this small program :)
